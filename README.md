# Semi Automated Fracture Detector (Modified Version). 2025
**Authors: Losarcos, J. M. and Bernardi, M. I.**
**Corresponding author: Juan Manuel Losarcos, University of Illinois Chicago (jlosa@uic.edu)**  

This repository contains a single MATLAB script (SAutomatedFractureDetector_v1_1.m) that implements an automated method for extracting digitized fractures from images of fractured rocks using the complex shearlet transform. The method is adapted from the manuscript titled *"An automated fracture trace detection technique using the complex shearlet transform", Prabhakaran et al. (2019).

## Contents

- **SAutomatedFractureDetector_v1_1.m**  
  Main script that runs the full fracture extraction workflow:  
  → Generates shearlet-based ridge ensemble from input rock images and parameter selection 
  → Applies sigmoid thresholding to filter probable fractures  
  → Segments and skeletonizes ridges  
  → Fits polylines to fracture traces  
  → Computes orientation and length statistics  
  → Exports results to Excel and generates rose diagrams and histograms  

  This version includes additional interactive tools for scale calibration and north orientation correction. For installation instructions, basic usage, input/output descriptions, reproducibility information for the manuscript examples, and known limitations, see USER_GUIDE.txt

## Notes on Modifications

This script consolidates all steps into a single executable file, with simplified outputs and no dependency on shapefile generation. Additional interactive modules allow users to calibrate real-world scale and magnetic north for each image.
